# Production Design

This document defines how to take the dependency-free baseline toward a
portfolio-quality production implementation. The goal is to demonstrate the
engineering around an AI model, not merely wrap a hosted inference API.

## Real-World Data Sources

| Source | Purpose | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hacker News API | Real content candidates for recommendation simulations | `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json` |
| Open-Meteo API | Real contextual features without authentication | `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=40.71&longitude=-74.01&current=temperature_2m` |

Use `python -m contextual_bandit.real_world` to fetch a small raw
snapshot. Review API terms, data licenses, rate limits, privacy, and retention
before building a durable ingestion job.

## Service Boundaries

- **Ingestion:** resumable API clients, raw snapshots, schema validation, and
  dead-letter handling.
- **Index/training:** versioned transformations, deterministic splits, and
  artifact lineage.
- **Online inference:** typed requests, confidence thresholds, evidence, and
  human review.
- **Evaluation:** offline golden sets, adversarial cases, release thresholds,
  and production feedback.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry traces, latency and cost metrics, model and
  prompt versions, and privacy-safe logs.

## Scaling Targets

- Beat a random policy by >= 20% average simulated reward
- Report IPS and doubly robust offline estimates
- Block 100% of disallowed actions before serving
- Serve policy decisions below 50 ms p95

## Data and Model Versioning

Store the source snapshot ID, transformation commit, dataset version, model
version, evaluation report, and deployment SHA together. A release is eligible
only when its evaluation thresholds pass in CI.

## Reliability

- Make ingestion and tool calls idempotent.
- Retry transient failures with bounded exponential backoff.
- Persist workflow state before external side effects.
- Add circuit breakers around remote APIs and model providers.
- Preserve the last known-good index and model for rollback.

## Security

- Use least-privilege credentials and secret managers.
- Enforce authorization before retrieval or tool execution.
- Redact sensitive fields before traces and logs.
- Validate uploaded documents and isolate parsing workloads.
- Require human approval for consequential state changes.
